# Hangman and SensorBot ðŸš€

This repository contains the **first-ever coding project** I created during my first semester of Computer Science. It includes two beginner-friendly C++ programs: a simple robot direction simulator using arrays and logic, and a playable console-based Hangman game.

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

These mini projects were created to apply basic C++ concepts like:

- Arrays and loops
- Functions and control structures
- Random number generation
- Basic logic design
- Console input/output

They represent my early understanding of problem-solving with code â€” and while simple, they were meaningful milestones in my programming journey.

## ðŸ’» What's Inside

### ðŸ”§ SensorBot
- Simulates a robot that senses distances in four directions (North, South, East, West)
- Chooses to move in the direction with the furthest detected distance
- Uses arrays, randomness, and logic to determine direction

### ðŸŽ® Hangman
- Classic word guessing game
- Draws a stick figure hangman as attempts run out
- Includes guessed letter tracking and input validation

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Structuring basic C++ programs
- Using arrays and functions effectively
- Writing logic-driven decision-making code
- Handling user input and console interactivity
